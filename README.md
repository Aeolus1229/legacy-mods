# Neverending Legacy Mod

I've been experimenting with modding Orteil's lesser known game [Neverending Legacy](https://orteil.dashnet.org/legacy/). This is derived from his example mod [which can be found here](https://orteil.dashnet.org/legacy/mod.js).

I highly recommend having a look at the game, and if for some reason you want to play the game with this, click 'Select Mods' in the upper right corner of the start screen and paste https://raw.githack.com/JakeSESaunders/Legacy-Mod/master/jake.js.
